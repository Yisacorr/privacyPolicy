    <p>Last updated: 06/16/2024</p>

        FlavorTrail ("us", "we", or "our") operates the FlavorTrail platform (the "Service").

        of personal information when you use our Service.
    </p>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Account Information: Name, email address, profile picture, and other optional details.</li>
        <li>Usage Data: Information about how you use the app, such as your activity on the platform, uploaded experiences, shared restaurants, saved wanderlist items, and interactions with other users.</li>
        <li>Location Data: With your permission, we may collect and process location data to provide features such as nearby restaurant recommendations and city-based filters.</li>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and improve the Service's features, such as personalized recommendations and statistics.</li>
        <li>To facilitate interactions and sharing between users.</li>
        <li>To process your requests and respond to your inquiries.</li>
        <li>To ensure the security and proper functioning of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
        We will not share your personal information with third parties except:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
        <li>To provide necessary functionality through trusted third-party service providers, such as Google for authentication or mapping services.</li>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take commercially reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no system is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Content Moderation</h2>
    <p>
        We use automated content moderation systems to ensure that user-uploaded images and text comply with our community guidelines. When you upload content such as profile photos or experiences:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your content may be automatically analyzed by third-party content moderation services (such as Sightengine) to detect potentially inappropriate, offensive, or harmful material.</li>
        <li>This analysis is performed in real-time before content is published to the Service, and content that violates our guidelines may be automatically rejected.</li>
        <li>The content moderation process involves temporarily sending your images and text to our service providers, who do not permanently store your content beyond the immediate analysis.</li>
        <li>We do not use your content to train AI models, and all moderation is conducted with privacy-preserving measures in place.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The moderation system helps maintain a safe and positive community environment. You can find more details about prohibited content in our Terms and Conditions.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        Account information is kept until you delete your account. After account deletion, we may retain certain information for legal purposes, analytics, or fraud prevention for up to 90 days, after which it is permanently deleted from our systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain non-identifying analytics data may be retained indefinitely in an aggregated form that cannot be used to identify you.
    </p>
    <p>
