                        <p>
                            We use automated content moderation systems to ensure that user-uploaded images and text comply with
                            our community guidelines. When you upload content such as profile photos or experiences:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your content may be automatically analyzed by third-party content moderation services (such as Sightengine) to detect potentially inappropriate, offensive, or harmful material.</li>
                            <li>This analysis is performed in real-time before content is published to the Service, and content that violates our guidelines may be automatically rejected.</li>
                            <li>The content moderation process involves temporarily sending your images and text to our service providers, who do not permanently store your content beyond the immediate analysis.</li>
                            <li>We do not use your content to train AI models, and all moderation is conducted with privacy-preserving measures in place.</li>
                        </ul>
