                            Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information,
                            text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you

                        <p>
                            By posting Content on or through the Service, You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours
                            (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as
                            provided in these Terms, and (ii) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not

                        <ul>

                            FlavorTrail employs automated content moderation systems to review all uploaded content. Content that
                            appears to violate these guidelines may be automatically rejected. Repeated attempts to post prohibited
                            content may result in account suspension or termination.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While we strive to create a positive community environment, the automated moderation system may
                            occasionally reject legitimate content. If you believe your content was incorrectly rejected, you may
                            contact support for review.
